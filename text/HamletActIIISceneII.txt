A hall in the castle.

Enter HAMLET and Players

HAMLET:
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

PLAYER:
I warrant your honour.

HAMLET:
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

PLAYER:
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.

HAMLET:
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that’s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

Exeunt Players

Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

HAMLET:
How now, my lord! Will the king hear this piece of work?

POLONIUS:
And the queen too, and that presently.

HAMLET:
Bid the players make haste.
[Exit POLONIUS]
Will you two help to hasten them?

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN:
We will, my lord.
[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]

HAMLET:
What, ho! Horatio!

Enter HORATIO

HAMLET:
There’s a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father’s death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.

HORATIO:
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And ’scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

HAMLET:
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.

Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

KING CLAUDIUS:
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

HAMLET:
Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

KING CLAUDIUS:
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.

HAMLET:
No, nor mine now. [To POLONIUS] My lord, you played once i’ the university, you say?

POLONIUS:
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

HAMLET:
What did you enact?

POLONIUS:
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i’ the Capitol; Brutus killed me.

HAMLET:
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

HAMLET:
No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.
[HAMLET takes a seat near OPHELIA]

POLONIUS:
[To the KING] Oh, ho! do you mark that?

HAMLET:
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

OPHELIA:
No, my lord.

HAMLET:
I mean, my head upon your lap?

OPHELIA:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
Do you think I meant country matters?

OPHELIA:
I think nothing, my lord.

HAMLET:
That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.

OPHELIA:
What is, my lord?

HAMLET:
Nothing.

OPHELIA:
You are merry, my lord.

HAMLET:
Who, I?

OPHELIA:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within’s two hours.

OPHELIA:
Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET:
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by’r lady, he must build churches then.

Trumpets sound. Dumb show follows:

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper’s ears and leaves him. The Queen returns; finds the King dead and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four come in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts: she seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.

[Exeunt Dumb Show]

OPHELIA:
What means this, my lord?

HAMLET:
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA:
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

HAMLET:
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.
